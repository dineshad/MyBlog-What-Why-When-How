What is "Convention over configuration"?

It's a software design paradigm used by software frameworks.
It means a developer only needs to specify unconventional aspects of the application.For example, if there is a class Sales in the model, the corresponding table in the database is called "sales" by default. It is only if one deviates from this convention, such as the table "product sales", that one needs to write code regarding these names.
