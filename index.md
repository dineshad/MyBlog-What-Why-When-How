What is "Convention over configuration"?

It's a software design paradigm used by software frameworks.
It means a developer only needs to specify unconventional aspects of the application.For example, if there is a class Sales in the model, the corresponding table in the database is called "sales" by default. It is only if one deviates from this convention, such as the table "product_sales", that one needs to write code regarding these names.

What are the important lines(declarations) in a HTML file and Why?
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>

VSCode

Typing "!" and pressing Enter generates HTML skeleton.
Typing ""link:css"" and pressing Enter generates ""<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">.
Typing "script:src" and pressing Enter generates "<script src=""></script>"
Similarly try "ul>li*3>a" , "button>img*3" etc. Replace 3 with any number you like.
