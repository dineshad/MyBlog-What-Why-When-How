What is "Convention over configuration"?

It's a software design paradigm used by software frameworks.
It means a developer only needs to specify unconventional aspects of the application.For example, if there is a class Sales in the model, the corresponding table in the database is called "sales" by default. It is only if one deviates from this convention, such as the table "product_sales", that one needs to write code regarding these names.

What are the important lines(declarations) in a HTML file and Why?
            
            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html lang="en">
            <head>
                <meta charset="UTF-8">
                <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
                <title>Document</title>
            </head>
            <body>

            </body>
            </html>
