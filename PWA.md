  No seperate apps for web and mobile and different apps for each popular mobile OS.
  
  
How to make a web application, a PWA?
 1. Make the web application installable / able to add to the home screen.
    
    How to achieve this:
    (i) Make sure the website is served from a secure(HTTPS) domain.
    (ii) Add a web manifest file to the web app.
    Link a file of type .webmanifest to index.html
    <link rel="manifest" href="manifest.webmanifest">
